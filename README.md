# Project: Automated Reporting using Python and SQL Server

I have completed a project that involved the development of an automated reporting system using Python and SQL Server. The system was connected to a company's ERP and was used to generate reports on employee attendance.

The project made use of several Python packages such as Pandas, Pyodbc, Numpy, and Os to extract, transform, and load data from the SQL Server database. The data was then cleaned and processed to generate the desired reports.

The system used SQL queries to extract data from the database and then used Pandas to manipulate and clean the data. The final processed data was then exported to excel files for further analysis.

The code provided in the description is a snippet of the entire project which show how the data is being extracted, transformed and loaded into a dataframe using SQL and Pandas. It also shows how the data is being cleaned and processed to generate the desired reports.

Overall, the project has demonstrated my ability to develop an automated reporting system using Python and SQL Server, and work with different data sources and databases. The project has provided a valuable solution to the company by automating the report generation process which has saved time and effort.
